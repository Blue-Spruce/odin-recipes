    <h2>No time to cook? Don't sweat it!</h2>
    <p>This recipe is for those crazy weeknights when you aren't feeling inspired to cook anything, but also don't want
        to go out to eat. In under 30 minutes, you'll be enjoying a quick and easy, satisfying dinner that's packed with
        veggies and plant-based protein.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tablespoons + 2 teaspoons avocado or olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 lb extra-firm tofu, pressed</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 medium red onion, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) bag fresh broccoli florets, about 5 cups</li>
        <li>rice of choice: white, brown or cauliflower</li>
        <li>green onions and sesame seeds, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Teriyaki Sauce</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Tablespoon avocado or olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup low-sodium tamari, or soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ Tablespoon maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh ginger, grated or minced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once hot (check to make sure tofu sizzles when you
            add it to the pan), add tofu and cook, flipping frequently, for about 10 minutes. It's done when all sides
            of the tofu cubes are golden. Transfer to a bowl or plate.</li>
        <li>While tofu is cooking, whisk together the ingredients for the sauce in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Add remaining 2 teaspoons oil to the same skillet. Add garlic and onion and cook until fragrant, about 2-3
            minutes. Add broccoli and red bell pepper to the skillet and cook for about 5 minutes. Add sauce and tofu to
            the skillet as well and cook for about 5 minutes longer, or until broccoli is tender, but crisp and bright
            green in color. Serve tofu stir-fry over rice of choice with green onions and sesame seeds for garnish.</li>
    </ol>
